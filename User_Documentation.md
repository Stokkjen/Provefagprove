## New Reservation
This is a window that pops up when you click the "New Reservation" button in either the Customer app or Admin app, where you can book a reservation.
### Overview
Here, you can see the window. If you're a customer, "Name" and "Phone" will automatically generate based on your user. If you're an Admin, you need to fill it in yourself. You also get to see the uptimes of the restaurant.

### Make reservation

### Holders
Here, you will get an overview over everyone who has reserved before. There's a field called: "Is In System". If it's checked, it means that the person made a reservation themselves, or exists in the system. If not, it probably means that an Admin added them by writing name and phone directly.

### Hide
You can click the "Hide" button under "Action". The holder will then hide. It can be brought back by clicking "Include Hidden". If you click "Show", it'll stop hiding.

### Anonymize
If someone wants to be anonymous, you can click "Anonymize", and if you're certain of your decision, you can click "Ok" in the warning. Name and phone will be stripped, and it will hide.

### Disappeared
You see that when I clicked "Anonymize" on "Test Holder", it disappeared, even though "Include Hidden" is on.
